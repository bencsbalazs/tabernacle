There is a story in the Bible when the tabernacle was built, and it was filled with gold, silver, and copper. The Bible also mentions the dimensions of the tabernacle, and the materials used to build it. Regardless of the reliability of the Bible, I find it interesting to calculate the values of the biblical units.

I was curious about the value of the tent in today's currency, so I calculated it.
